# Cancer-Prediction
This model aims to predict breast cancer type as either malignant or benign based on the best features(independent variables). Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

As a part of this project, I have used classification models like Logistic Regression accompanied by Ensemble models like Random Forest, ADA Boost, XG Boost in order to 

This dataset has 569 rows and 33 columns out of which we want to identify the best set of variables predicting the cancer survival rate.
